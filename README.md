# tedxcsuf.org
Website for TEDXCSUF built using TemplatedCo's html, CSS, and JS base. All files encoded by me using php and compatible html/css design.

The website is the culmination of 2 months work and is built mobile first with tablet and desktop compatability. The repository name is the url for the website and serves as an
online info page for the organization TEDxCSUF. TEDxCSUF is a branch of TED based on the CSUF campus whose mission is to host TED events, promote learning, techonology, design,
and public speaking.
