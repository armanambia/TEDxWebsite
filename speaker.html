                    <p class = 'desc'> 
                        Ximena Yanez is a current CSUF student majoring in Business Marketing. With the intent to follow her interests in the fashion and makeup industry, she continues her studies in hopes of finding her place. Ximena thrives in all she does, driven by optimism, responsibility, and boldness, allowing her to continuously shape her path- despite many hardships. She is currently the Social Media Coordinator for Titan Communications on the CSUF campus. There she has developed her skills in Public Relations, Marketing, and Social Media. Additionally, she has gained strong public speaking skills from participating in speech competitions and events. In her free time, she furthers her artistic prowess by developing her makeup skills and adding to her thrifted vintage collection of clothing and accessories. Ximena is a huge advocate of mental health awareness and self-confidence. Her poem’s intention is to inspire many, in the hopes of improving one’s self-esteem and helping them achieve liberation. Ximena’s poem originates from an English assignment in her 11th-grade year of high school. After her poem was erased in her old student account she found a way to re-write 90 percent of the original poem. However, just like Ximena, her poem has changed, adhering to a newer and more mature perspective.
