                        Michelle Mehta is an alumna of Cal State Fullerton. According to ABC Television, “She has overcome unthinkable obstacles and is one of the most successful teen coaches in 2020.” Yahoo Finance named her as “Top 11 Female Coaches to Follow in 2021.” Michelle speaks to teens all over the country about overcoming peer pressure, bullying, and low self-worth by increasing their confidence to live a life they fully love and admire themselves every single day. James Haven (Angelina Jolie’s brother) states, “what we see in our world are coaches who train themselves based on old or new ways, but still in a formulaic way. Michelle does not do this. Michelle listens and then coaches. There is no greater way, and that is the most important compliment I can give her.” She is a Teen Confidence Expert, 2X International Bestselling Author, and Celebrity Coach. <a href = "www.michellemehta.com" target = "_blank">www.michellemehta.com</a>

                    Alexander Santana was born and raised in Tecolotlán, Jalisco, Mexico.  He is the youngest of five siblings and is first in his family to attend and graduate from college.  Alex migrated to United States at 18 and became a US citizen 19 years later.  At 22, he became a Seminarian at the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Additionally, he attended the Executive Business Management Program at the University of California Los Angeles, Anderson School of Business and later earned an Associate of Arts degree in Architecture from Fullerton College. He turned these skills into a business focused on design and contracting. Alex’s journey continued with 10 years of service in the United States Navy. He deployed to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2006 and 2007. Upon his return home he became an activist working with the non-profit Vet’s Journey Home. After suffering a clinical death and a diagnosis of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, the Veterans Administration rated Alex 100% Disabled.  As such, he was unable to restart his business, utilize his academic experience or continue pursuit of a Bachelor’s degree in Architecture. Alex was met with hardships at the Veteran’s Administration and realized that a career change was necessary. He is currently pursuing Bachelor of Sciences in Human Services at California State University Fullerton, with emphasis in Gerontology and a minor in Psychology. Alex’s diverse life experiences have taught him the meaning of inclusion, neglect, and commitment.
